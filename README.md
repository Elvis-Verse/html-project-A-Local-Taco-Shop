Goal
- Certify myself as an expert in HTML
So, I created a 100% HTML website for a Local Taco Shop by:
- creating multiple pages on my website
- creative in-page navigation links to sections within a page and to other pages
- using font hierarchy for styling and semantics.
- using well-sorted royalty-free images to animate the page.
